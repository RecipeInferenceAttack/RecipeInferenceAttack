trigger,trigger_description
Total Power Consumption three phases,This trigger fires when the consumed power satisfies a condition with a treshold
Temperature Sensor,This trigger fires when the temperature satisfies a condition with a threshold
Contact Interface Status,This trigger fires based on the state (on/off/changing)
Produced Power single phase,This trigger fires when the produced power satisfies a condition with a threshold
Room HVAC Mode,This trigger fires when occurs a variation of HVAC mode if the state satisfies a condition
Total Power Consumption single phase,This trigger fires when the consumed power satisfies a condition with a threshold
Rain Amount,This trigger fires when rain amount satisfies a condition with a threshold
Exchanged Power single phase,This trigger fires when the exchanged power satisfies a condition with a threshold
Room Temperature,This trigger fires when the room temperature satisfies a condition with a threshold
Room Temperature Setpoint,This trigger fires when the setpoint temperature satisfies a condition with a threshold
Wind Speed,This trigger fires when wind speed satisfies a condition with a threshold
